// Here we will learn about types.

// A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar
// types: integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and characters. You’ll
// likely recognize these from other programming languages, but let’s
// jump into how they work in Rust.

fn main() {
    let age : i32 = 29;
    println!("{}", age);
